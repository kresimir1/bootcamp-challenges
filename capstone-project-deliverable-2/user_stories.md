- an app where new parents can follow their child’s progress
- Similar to instructions you get at the pediatricians office you get all the information what to expect at a certain age only here you get some extra features
 - you can make a profile for your child (that only you can see)
- on that profile by putting your child age you get info what to expect and a form where you can add progress (how much sleep, height, weight, vaccination, when baby starts rolling over, sitting up, crawling and walking, first teeth….)
- you would have standard questions you get at the pediatricians office so you would know what was expected and what you needed to pay attention to
- first words feature: you can add each new word that your baby learns or that you are trying to teach them. I addition you can add a picture of that so you can keep repeating and practicing with your baby. Clicking on the link of the words on your profile would show you the total words count as well as the list of words and pictures (if any)
- summary feature – an option to print out the summary of all the relevant info (for example as reminder before going to the doctors office)
- the app would also have a page where new and interesting articles could be added and a chat room for the members (where they could ask questions and discus interesting topics)
- EXTRA FEATURE: (if I can figure it out () – Growth chart: a feature that would use the height data that you input and prints out a marked growth chart using simple set of A4 papers you can print out and tape together. This would preferably be in word or PDF format so that users send it to their family and friends with a simple email (for example grandparents living far away).
