## Generating Capstone Project Ideas

It's time to start brainstorming on some ideas for your capstone project! You're not pitching a venture capitalist on the next killer application idea. The key is to pick something that interests you, and that will demonstrate your talents as a developer. Don't worry too much about the idea or concept itself.

Questions you can ask yourself that may help generate ideas:

- In your current or previous jobs, is there some kind of software you wish you had to make your work life easier?
    - If you are a nurse, you could write an app that logs when you administered medication
    - If you work as a lab tech, you could write an app that keeps track of experiment results
    - If you are a consultant, you could write an app that logs your team's interactions with clients
- Could you enjoy or improve your happiness in a favorite pastime or hobby?
    - If you garden, you may need something that keeps track of what you planted and when
    - If you play hockey, you may write an app that tracks your games, goals, and assists
    - If you like to cook, you could write something that keeps track of your favorites recipes, and when you cook them
- Is there software you could write that would help you achieve a life goal?
    - If you want to exercise more, you may write something that reminds you and motivates you to exercise
    - If you want to obtain a new job in software, you may want to build something that keeps track of your job leads
    - If you want a better relationship with your significant other, you may decide to build something that keeps track of date nights, where you went, and how romantic it was
- Is there a nonprofit or cause you could help by writing software for it?
    - You could write a system that keeps track of donors and donations
    - You could write a system that shares some of the stories and achievements the nonprofit is achieving
    - You could write a system that helps to maintain relationships with benefactors
- Does a friend or a family member have a software idea or need in their work? (A caveat here: you should not provide any guarantee or expectation that this software will be fully usable for them at the end of your capstone project. This will put undue pressure on yourself)

Again, the key here is, to work with an idea that is interesting to you, not something that is going to be the next Facebook. Plus, you can improve and add on to the idea even after your time at Launch Academy. It doesn't have to be a million dollar idea, and the focus should be more around how it will challenge you technically.

## Submitting

Please submit 1-3 ideas for your Capstone Project, with a brief paragraph description for each one. When describing your idea, please consider the following questions:

- What is the very first feature you will start out with? (This means 1-2 models, and some simple functionality that you can deploy early.)
- Are there several models involved in your app, along with CRUD for each one? (There should be!)
- Do you have some ideas for "fancy" features you can incorporate into your app if you have time? (e.g., APIs, data visualization, cool JS or AJAX features?)
- Does my idea align with my personal hobbies or interests? If not, it might be tough staying personally invested in building out this idea.
- Can my idea be implemented as a Web Application written in the Rails web framework? If not, that's a problem. Your Capstone Project is required to be a web application, written in the Rails framework, with unit and acceptance tests.

If you're not feeling very certain about what you want to do, please submit several ideas so we can talk through the different options with you.

If you're feeling very stuck, don't spend too much time worrying about coming up with the "perfect idea" - just write down a couple things, even if you think none of your ideas are any good, and we can help you build them up from there!

Once you've submitted the assignment, please send it to to your Senior Technical Instructor. If youâ€™d like additional feedback, feel free to discuss with the instructor on chat support.
