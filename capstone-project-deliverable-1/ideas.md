# Capstone Project Ideas

<Your ideas, here>
1. Scheduler:
-  app for small retail and other businesses
-  weekly schedule for employees
-  calendar option to create schedules up to 4 weeks in advance
-  it has a form to input all the HR relevant data for an employee (personal info, availability, pay rate, full-time/part-time)
-  it has request forms for vacation, leave of absence or sick leave
-  manager: can create, edit or delete employee data and schedule
-  members/employees can see the schedule, and put in requests (vacation , leave of absence, ect….)
-  hours can be limited for part-time /full-time employees so the manager gets a warning message if tries to schedule over that time or at the time when employee is unavailable
-  EXTRA FEATURE: (depending on the progress speed): weekly templates – an option to create custom templates so that the schedule doesn’t have to created from scratch every week)


2. Musicians/talents app
- to promote / manage young artists
- app where young  artists can post their music, videos and pictures
- it has a main page with all the artists  (depending on the votes the ones with the best ratings showing up first)
- it has a “newly added” page where the artists are sorted by the “last added shows first on the list” (only artists added in the last 7 days show)
- a member can create, edit and delete their profile, comment or vote on other members (only like or upvote and only once for one artist)
- on the profile/show page there is a calendar with availability and booking options for the artist
- each time the artist gets booked through the app they get extra points to improve their ranking on the main chart
-  it has a special link/page to promote the artist of the month (the one with the most votes for the last month)
- the artist of the year gets 1 million dollars from Launch Academy (just checking if you are reading this carefully :)
- EXTRA FEATURE: add clubs (only clubs that book young artists) - members can vote on the clubs and clubs can vote on the artists (only on the ones that performed there)
- a club vote brings more points then regular member (for example 10)



3. Babies app
- an app where new parents can follow their child’s progress
- Similar to instructions you get at the pediatricians office you get all the information what to expect at a certain age only here    you get some extra features
- you can make a profile for your child (that only you can see)
- on that profile by putting your child age you get info what to expect and a form where you can add progress (how much sleep, height, weight, vaccination, when baby starts rolling over, sitting up, crawling and walking, first teeth….)
- you would have standard questions you get at the pediatricians office so you would know what was expected and what you needed to pay attention to
- first words feature: you can add each new word that your baby learns or that you are trying to teach them. I addition you can add a picture of that so you can keep repeating and practicing with your baby. Clicking on the link of the words on your profile would show you the total words count as well as the list of words and pictures (if any)
- summary feature – an option to print out the summary of all the relevant info (for example as reminder before going to the doctors office)
- the app would also have a page where new and interesting articles could be added and a chat room for the members (where they could ask questions and discus interesting topics)
- EXTRA FEATURE: (if I can figure it out () – Growth chart: a feature that would use the height data that you input and prints out a marked growth chart using simple set of A4 papers you can print out and tape together. This would preferably be in word or PDF format so that users send it to their family and friends with a simple email (for example grandparents living far away).
